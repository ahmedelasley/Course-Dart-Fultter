2. Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart.

1 - var
var uses type inference: Dart determines the type from the first assigned value, and then the variable becomes that type permanently (you can’t later assign a different type).

2- dynamic
dynamic disables static type checking for that variable: it can hold values of any type at runtime (you can assign a String then later an int).

3- explicitly
Explicitly typed variables (e.g., int age = 20;, String name = 'Ali';) have a fixed type you declare. You can only assign values of that type.
